Requirements: php installed with added path (this tutorial can be useful https://youtu.be/7oUeCXstB8w) and a browser.

Open cmd and type=>
php -S localhost:4000
and click enter. You should see something like: [date time year] PHP *version* Development Server (http://localhost:4000) started"

!remember to not close the prompt window!

Put the php file into your user folder of your pc, like C:\Users\Mike (Mike is an example of an user name).

Open a browser and in the search bar type=>
http://localhost:4000/*your php file, in this case riccio333.php* 
and click enter.
