Hello bozo,

In this repository I put different hello world programs with different programming languages.
//I write riccio333 on top instead of hello world in all programs :O

To open this programs there are exe files, cmd commands or use a browser. In each folder I put an help.md file with requirements and how to open the files :)

I made this for fun, I was bored and i was thinking: "what if I create many programs that say riccio333 on top in different languages?" so I did it.
Idk why i'm posting this on github but ok :flushed:
